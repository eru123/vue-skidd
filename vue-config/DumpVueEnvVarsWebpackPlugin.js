/**
 * We to configure the service-worker to cache calls to both the API and the
 * static content server but these are configurable URLs. We already use the env var
 * system that vue-cli offers so implementing something outside the build
 * process that parses the service-worker file would be messy. This lets us
 * dump the env vars as configured for the rest of the app and import them into
 * the service-worker script to use them.
 *
 * We need to do this as the service-worker script is NOT processed by webpack
 * so we can't put any placeholders in it directly.
